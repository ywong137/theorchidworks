            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Located on the lush Hamakua Coast of Hawaii, The Orchid Works specializes in growing and shipping healthy, vibrant orchids to enthusiasts and collectors around the world. Each plant is raised with care and passion by Jessica and her dedicated team.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We mainly specialize in plugs, non-blooming and some blooming orchids from time to time when available.</p>
            <p>We have several varieties available from cattleya, dendrobium, phalaenopsis, oncidium, and vanda orchids. We know most everyone (small island, lots of growers), so if you're looking for something special, let us know and we'll try to find it for you!</p>p>
            <p>We are located on the Windward side of the Big Island, along one of the most amazing stretches of scenery, the Hamakua Coast. It's the perfect climate to grow orchids!</p>
